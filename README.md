# ngNodeS3

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.0.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).

## Instructions: 

Start the nodejs server by typing in the command: `npm start` in the terminal at `..\ngNodeS3\nodeS3\`. Then, while the nodejs server is still running, start the front end application by typing in the command `ng serve --port 3000 -o` or `npm start` in the terminal at `..\ngNodeS3\`. This will open up the application in your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`. 

## Heads up:

Right now I do not have the search users, or messaging functions working(not really started on the search users thing, not sure where to start, and I tried to set up comments on a different angular app with firebase but it did not work). Also right now this is just a communal file dump, not really a file transfer app... I am in need of a bit of assistance :/
