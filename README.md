## Instructions: 

Start the nodejs server by typing in the command: `npm start` in the terminal at `..\ngNodeS3\nodeS3\`. Then, while the nodejs server is still running, start the front end application by typing in the command `ng serve --port 3000 -o` or `npm start` in the terminal at `..\ngNodeS3\`. This will open up the application in your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`.
